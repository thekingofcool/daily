<p>These charts offer a compelling perspective on demographic shifts, particularly concerning working-age populations in Japan and China, and their broader implications for investment. From an investment standpoint, these trends highlight significant challenges and potential opportunities arising from aging societies and declining workforces.</p>

<p>Demographic Trends in Japan and China
The first chart directly compares the population structures of Japan and China, focusing on the period from 1995 to a projected 2035. It illustrates that both nations are experiencing a decline in their working-age populations, though at different magnitudes and timelines. China’s working-age population, represented by the blue line on the left axis (in hundreds of millions), peaked around 2015. Japan’s working-age population, shown by the pink line on the right axis (also in hundreds of millions), appears to have peaked earlier, around 1994, and is on a more sustained downward trajectory.</p>

<p>The second chart provides a more granular forecast for China’s working-age population (18-64 years) from 1990 to 2100. It shows a significant peak in 2015 at 1 billion people, followed by a “plateau/soft decline” that is projected to transition into a “rapid decline” from around 2030 onwards. The chart presents two scenarios: a median scenario with a rebound in fertility and a constant fertility scenario, both indicating a substantial decrease in the working-age population by the end of the century.</p>

<p>The third exhibit, “The decline in working age population growth rates is sharpest in the emerging world,” quantifies the projected change in working-age population growth rates between 2005 and 2030. It clearly positions both China and Japan among the countries with the most significant negative growth rate changes. China is projected to experience a decline of approximately -2.0 percentage points, while Japan faces a drop of around -0.75 percentage points. This highlights that while Japan’s decline has been ongoing, China’s demographic dividend is rapidly diminishing, with its working-age population set to shrink at an accelerating pace.</p>

<p>Investment Insights
The demographic data presented has several crucial investment insights:</p>

<p>Labor Shortages and Wage Pressures: The shrinking working-age population in both Japan and China will inevitably lead to labor shortages. This can drive up wages, impacting the cost of production for businesses and potentially squeezing profit margins. Companies operating in sectors heavily reliant on manual labor or with a significant cost base of wages will need to adapt through automation, increased efficiency, or by relocating production to regions with more favorable demographics.</p>

<p>Consumption Patterns and Market Demand: An aging population typically signifies a shift in consumption patterns. Demand for healthcare, elder care services, retirement products, and leisure activities is likely to increase. Conversely, demand for goods and services typically consumed by younger demographics, such as education, childcare, and certain consumer electronics, might see slower growth or decline. Investors should therefore consider sectors that cater to the needs of an older population.</p>

<p>Innovation and Automation as Investment Themes: The necessity to compensate for a declining workforce will spur innovation in automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Countries like Japan and China, facing these demographic challenges, are likely to be at the forefront of developing and adopting such technologies. Investments in companies that provide solutions in these areas, or those that effectively integrate them into their operations, could offer significant growth potential.</p>

<p>Shifting Economic Power and Emerging Markets: While China’s demographic dividend is fading, its sheer size means it will remain a critical economic player. However, the “rapid decline” phase suggests that the era of its population-driven growth is nearing its end. This could impact its position as a global manufacturing hub and its economic growth trajectory. For investors, this necessitates a more nuanced approach to emerging market investments, focusing on countries with more sustainable demographic profiles or those that can effectively navigate these demographic headwinds through policy and innovation.</p>

<p>The “Silver Economy” Opportunity: Japan, as a more mature aging society, offers a case study for the development of the “silver economy.” Industries that successfully cater to the needs and preferences of seniors, from specialized financial services to accessible housing and transportation, are likely to thrive. China, as it ages, will present a similar, albeit larger, market opportunity.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the declining working-age populations in Japan and China represent a fundamental economic shift. For investors, this trend underscores the importance of strategic adaptation, focusing on sectors driven by demographic needs, embracing technological advancements that mitigate labor scarcity, and carefully evaluating the long-term growth prospects of economies grappling with these demographic realities.</p>
